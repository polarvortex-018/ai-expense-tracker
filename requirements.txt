# TensorFlow Lite requires the full TensorFlow package to load assets, 
# unless you specifically use a smaller TFLite runtime package.
# Since you used tf.lite.Interpreter, we will include a version of TensorFlow.
# NOTE: Deploying TensorFlow on Streamlit Cloud can be heavy.
# If you used a specific lightweight package for TFLite, use that instead.
